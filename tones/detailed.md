## Example Bullets

- Implemented OAuth2 authentication support (#124) - This adds support for Google, GitHub, and custom OAuth2 providers, allowing users to authenticate using existing credentials. The implementation follows RFC 6749 standards and includes proper token refresh handling. Users can now bypass username/password authentication in favor of their preferred identity provider.

- Fixed critical memory leak in WebSocket connection handler (#123) - Resolved an issue where connection objects weren't properly garbage collected during reconnection scenarios, leading to memory accumulation over extended periods. This particularly affected long-running applications with frequent connection changes. The fix implements proper cleanup in the connection lifecycle and adds monitoring for connection pool health.

- Optimized database query performance for user lookups (#127) - Refactored the user authentication query to use indexed columns and reduced N+1 query patterns. This change improves login response times by approximately 60% and reduces database load during peak usage. Applications with large user bases will see the most significant improvements.

## Example Summary

This release addresses critical performance and security concerns while expanding authentication capabilities. The memory leak fix resolves stability issues in production environments, OAuth2 integration modernizes the authentication flow, and database optimizations improve scalability for high-traffic deployments. Together, these changes create a more robust foundation for enterprise usage.
